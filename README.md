# COVID-19 Impact on K-12 Students 

All around the world, K-12 students are adapting to the changes put in place by COVID-19. Schools are now conducted online, meaning that 
students are increasingly reliant on the resources available at home. Students at a significant disadvantage include those from low-income 
housholds, without access to home internet, with parents suffering from job instability, and in single-parent homes. 
HPE is committed to making a positive impact on the community and knows firsthand the advantage technology can provide.
This data visualization tool uses a dataset from [...] to compare the percentages of students in each state living in poverty, without internet access, in homes
with job instability, and living with a single parent. Each of these targeted communities needs extra support during the pandemic, and HPE
has the resources to make a difference.
